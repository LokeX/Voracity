all fields of the board are ascribed a value (possibly an amalgam of values) 
- but these values are only of value to a player if they are on touch or sight of that players pieces
- these values  declines over distance by a certain percentage

field	value 	
green 	1.000	
blue	1 = 4.000, 2 = 2 * 2.500, 3 = 3 * 2.000, 4 = 4 * 1.500, 5 = 5 * 1.000

distance (in fields):	percentage:
	0		100
	1-6		50/30 (only the most valuable 1,2,3,4,5 & 6 gets 50 %)
	7		25
	8		24
	9		22
	10		20
	11		18
