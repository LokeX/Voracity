blue cards:
 
(events) are (usually) not held but effectuated immediately
(pay cards) moves pieces in special ways
(score cards) ascribes nominal values to fields (usually for one piece in range only)
	1 field - 1 piece		
		nominal value added to field (unique field = 20.000, quintet = 10.000)
	2 fields - 1 piece on each	
		nominal value added to field (unique field = 20.000, quintet = 10.000)
			when a field is occupied its nominal value is added to the remaining field
to the remaining field
	2 fields - 2 pieces on each 	
		nominal value added twice to each field (unique field = 37.500)
			when a field is occupied its nominal value is added to the remaining fields
	1 + X fields - 1 + X pieces	
		nominal value added to field (unique field = 10.000, quintet = 25.000)

if more than 3 blue cards are held calculate their practical value before any optional action OR rolling the dice 
	simulate optional actions (based on nominal value of all blue cards held)
	simulate all 6 dice rolls (based on nominal value of all blue cards held)
		simulate optional actions (based on nominal value of all blue cards held)
		simulate discarding of blue cards 
			each blue card now has (percentage of keeping): 
				0, 17, 33, 50, 67, 83 or 100 
	practical value = nominal value * (percentage of keeping)
		score cards now ascribes practical values to fields (ie 20.000 * 0,67 = 13.400)



	simulate all dice rolls AND optional actions: 
	(green field to yellow), dice moves, remove pieces, return pieces, execution of blue cards etc. 
	list all end scenarios and determine for each card the (choice) percentage of it being amongst 
	- the 3 most valuable cards OR cards effectuated 
	practical value of each card = (choice) percentage * nominal value of each card


when no more moves are possible or increases

if more than 3 blue cards are held and now some must be discarded
	


how likely that each card won't be discarded at end of turn
		
			percentage likelihood of keeping (or effectuating) the card is transferred to score card values
			- value of pay cards to be determined later

the full value of a blue card is usually divided by a number of fields involved
